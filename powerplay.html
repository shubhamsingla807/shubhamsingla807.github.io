				<p>
					At powerplay, we admire experiments a lot, we build the
					hypothesis, work upon it and test it live with the user. As
					a part of implementation POD of the product team, I also got
					the chance to build & run experiments. Initially when I
					joined Powerplay, I was little nervous because of the two
					reasons, the very first was obvious as it was my first PM
					job and the second is the construction industry. I came from
					an Ed-tech B2C field & I have no idea how does the
					contruction + SaaS industry looks like.
				</p>
				<p>
					But, who knows learning new things could be so interesting.
					I was able to run experiments own my own and then looking
					through data gives me goosebumps every single time & that’s
					a story for another day, but for now lets deep dive into the
					details of work :)
				</p>
				<h3 class="blue" style="text-align: center; margin: 10px">
					Brief Overview
				</h3>
				<p>
					Probably you haven’t heard about Powerplay earlier, right?
					Powerplay is a construction management & communication
					mobile application. In simple terms consider it like Slack +
					Trello but for construction industry. I was highly
					influenced by the problem that they’re solving which I
					myself faced in my life. Powerplay helps to reduce the
					friction between the site team & office team so that they
					can collaborate effectively.
				</p>
				<h4>Impact it created :</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Saw an increase of
						<strong>8 times in the base metric</strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						Quality metric got increased by <strong>2 times</strong>
					</li>
					<li>
						Helped increase the <strong>retention</strong> on the
						platform by <strong>1.5 times</strong>
					</li>

				<h2>Proccess</h2>
				<p>
					The process is simple, we first identify what’s the problem,
					then layout a Epic, map things with the definition of our
					Implementation POD, work on solving the problem starting
					with user research, putting down user journey’s, their goals
					& needs and finally the multiple solutions to test with the
					users. If I had to write it in the process, then it would go
					like -
				</p>
				<div class="img-container">
					<img src="./images/powerplay/proccess1.png" alt="" />
				</div>
				<p>
					Now as a part of Implementation POD, we have our definition
					with us and we need to move those numbers. So, we need to
					build the plan on how to improve these numbers. Our POD
					focuses on to make sure
					<span class="blue">
						users make an investment in the product so that they are
						ready to get retained & became an active user in the
						product.</span
					>
				</p>
				<p>
					Okay let’s first understand a basic flow of user journey, so
					that you could have a better idea -
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>User signs up on the application.</li>
					<li>
						User was prompted to create a new site. (As a user from
						construction industry, they used to create sites. Here
						site denotes the place where construction work is going
						on).
					</li>
					<li>User created a site.</li>
					<li>
						User was asked to create different tasks. (Here tasks
						denotes the site work that construction industry workers
						do for ex - Bricking, Lintel, Foundation etc.)
					</li>
					<li>
						User creates a task and do a lot of other stuff as well.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					After this there are many more things a user does but here,
					I didn’t go into the much detailed journey as my POD comes
					under this journey only, when user created a site our main
					motive is to make sure user creates more tasks & realize the
					value of our application. Now to make sure user do the
					intended action, we devised a strategy.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="problem" class="section4 outside-margin">
				<h2>Current process of creating tasks</h2>
				<div class="img-container">
					<img
						style="width: 80%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section4_1.png"

			</section>
			<section id="strategy" class="section5 outside-margin">
				<h2>New strategy</h2>
				<p>
					Along with providing value to our user we need to make sure
					user also makes an investment in our product . To do so, we
					came up with two major epics one is
					<span class="blue">“Pre-built templates”</span> & other is
					<span class="blue">“Upload Plan”</span>. Now by names it
					would be hard to identify what exactly are these, I’ll try
					to explain them below -
				</p>
				<div class="img-container">
					<img
						style="width: 50%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_1.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					<strong>Pre-built templates</strong> - Currently user had to
					manually create every task and generally in construction
					industry there are a lot of tasks, so our assumption was if
					we help users built tasks easily with our templates then we
					can motivate them to build more & help them to stay active
					on the platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Upload plan</strong> - We found that users already
					had some site plans & tasks created with them either in the
					form of Excel or PDF which they used to communicate with
					other members of their team. If we were able to get them
					their plans uploaded on our application, then the burden of
					creating tasks from scratch would be over and they could
					easily use our application.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently, I’m working on
					<strong>Pre-built templates</strong> feature, so further
					would be explaining the same.
				</p>
				<h2>MVP Building</h2>
				<p>
					Now we have the problem, to solve the same we need to build
					hypothesis based upon user journey & insights. Before simply
					building the complete design, we also validated whether
					showing templates is a good idea or not? We build a small
					MVP to test the same and the numbers are good, then we
					proceeded with multiple nudge points and use cases.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_2.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					In the above experiment, the task accuracy is not that good,
					but we got to know user actually find them useful and to
					make it better, we decide to create different nudge points
					where it provides more value to user, also conducted user
					calls to get better clarity on the type of tasks. Also,
					we’re showing templates to these users once they at least
					added a single task.
				</p>
				<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 40px">
					<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
						<img
							style="width: 100%"

							alt=""
						/>
					</div>
					<p style="flex-grow: 5">
						In this, “Test” is the data of the experiment and
						“Control” is the data of general flow. Clearly
						activation of the experiment is higher than the general
						flow over the same period of time.
					</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section id="hypothesis" class="section6 outside-margin">
				<h2>Building multiple hypothesis and experiments</h2>
				<p>
					Now after this there are certain places where we can provide
					different value to the user based upon multiple nudge
					points. To do the same, we need to identify those values and
					needs to show it to the user. The point is
					<strong
						>wherever we saw the more usage of templates, we could
						say that this is the place where user finds the more
						value</strong
					>
					and could be used further for 100% rollout.

						<h3>
							1. Site Creation
							<span class="blue">
								(Prioritized One - 1st Flow)</span
							>
						</h3>
						<p>
							For the very first time, we decided to go with
							showing templates to the users at the time of 1st
							site creation, reason being is this is already
							tested and had given good numbers, apart from that
							this is the place where there are more eyes and help
							us adoption in templates.
						</p>
						<strong>
							Hypothesis - “As a user, I know what tasks to
							create, but there are a lot of tasks to create
							manually, if I’m able to choose from predefined
							tasks list, then creating new tasks would be easy
							and effortless for me.”

					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_4.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Certain changes that we did in this from the past exp is
					improvement in design + improvement in suggested tasks.
					Also, earlier suggestions are shown in a way, that it’s
					uncomfortable for the user and once canceled these couldn’t
					be viewed again. Now
					<strong
						>suggestions are shown in a way in which user can hide
						and open them as needed</strong
					>. Moreover, these suggestions would disappear once a user
					adds a minimum of 15 tasks or click on “Add all tasks”.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_5.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<h2>Why 2 flows?</h2>
				<p>
					We have created two flows, to verify & understand at what
					placement or in which scenario the user tends to use
					templates more. The better we got implementation %, the
					better are the chances users would stick to the platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the <strong>1st scenario</strong>, we are showing
					suggestions to the user, allowing him/her to add tasks at
					any moment, while creating tasks. In the 2nd scenario, we’re
					asking users to pre-select tasks early and then showing
					selected tasks directly in the tasks list. (Here selecting
					at least a single task is mandatory to proceed for the
					user).
				</p>
				<p>
					The
					<strong
						>2nd version of the same was not prioritized for
						now</strong
					>, reason being is in this we are asking users to select at
					least one of the task initially to proceed, which is a risk
					for us, as if user doesn’t find a particular task then
					chances are high user won’t proceed further. Thus, we
					rejected this flow for the time being.
				</p>
				<div class="highlight-container">
					<div class="one-highlight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h3>2. At the time of 2nd Site Creation</h3>
						<p>
							Now instead of showing templates on 1st site, our
							assumption is user had realised the value of PP and
							now starts creating 2nd site, but now it seems like
							a pain for user, as adding repetitive tasks is not
							easy for the user, so allowing users to onbaord
							tasks from past site well along with suggestions. 
						</p>
						<strong>
							Hypothesis - “As a user, I want to create another
							site, but creating tasks from beginning is
							difficult, if I can edit/onboard tasks from my
							previous site, then I can create new site with
							easily and can explore more.”
						</strong>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_6.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<div class="highlight-container">
					<div class="one-highlight" data-aos="fade-right">
						<h3>3. When user had created his 1st task</h3>
						<p>
							Again here our assumption is user had created one
							task and realised creating more tasks is hard, so if
							at the time when user had created his task, he would
							able to better realise the value of templates.  
						</p>
						<strong>
							Hypothesis - “As a user, I created one task, but if
							I can create multiple tasks, then my chances of
							creating more tasks would increase and help me
							completing my project.”
						</strong>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_7.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Apart from these there are certain different nudge points
					are there, but these are the more important ones. Now the
					next thing is the <strong>priortization</strong>, among all
					these we need to indentify one that would go live for the
					new users.
				</p>
				<p>
					From all of these we prioritized the first one reason being
					is -
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>It was already tested and had given good results</li>
					<li>More eyes are on this page (User engagement)</li>
					<li>
						First phase where user realised the pain of creating
						multiple tasks
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Also for this experiment one of the
					<strong>riskiest assumption</strong> we have taken is that
					<strong
						>“What if users didn’t find the tasks relatable
						according to their work?”</strong
					>
					To make sure all tasks are fine, we conducted 1-1 user calls
					+ check data to create the new task list that resonates with
					the users. First we conducted user calls and for that we got
					the data of users from business & success team.
				</p>
				<h2>User calls & data analysis</h2>
				<p>
					The only thing that remains little difficult for me in this
					industry is user calls, yes I love talking with users but in
					construction industry it’s very hard to get insights from
					the users, main problem arises when users didn’t answers the
					call. Even I had to drop a few calls because of the language
					they speak. But after conducting
					<strong>30+ user calls</strong>, we were able to get some
					insights on the type of tasks they create.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 50%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_8.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					<strong>Goal </strong>- To better understand what types of
					tasks a user creates and how their current process looks
					like. What kind of tools do they use to create tasks or do
					things?
				</p>
				<p>
					Here are the <strong>questions I asked</strong>, I formated
					the questions in Hindi, as users understand that language
					only - 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Aap currently kis team (like office ya site) ki side se
						kaam krte hn or aapka role kya hai currently?
					</li>
					<li>
						Aapka day to day role smjhaynge ek baar ki, kaise aap
						day start krte hn or kya task hota hai generally jab aap
						kisi project pr kaam krte hn?
					</li>
					<li>
						To jaise ki aap road construction(/industrial) projects
						pr kaam krte hn, to usme aap project ko kaise initate
						krte hn, matlab sabse phli cheeg kya hoti hai fir next &
						next? (Deep dive here)
					</li>
					<li>
						Kis type ke tasks aap create krte hn initially, any
						examples?
					</li>
					<li>
						Project complete hone ke baad, aap kya krte hn next?
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					From these user calls, the main motive is to understand the
					type of tasks they create and how’s their journey looks
					like. Upon overall analysis we had created a set of tasks in
					multiple categories such as Residential, Commercial etc.
					Apart from this we also checked the tasks created by users
					in the application already, we segregated data and build
					clusters based upon similarity of the type of project. But,
					the tasks we were able to identify are the general one and
					not that deep.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 50%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_9.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<h2>Dev Handoff</h2>
				<p>
					Now we have the basic tasks lists and experiment ready, the
					time is to launch the experiment with a limited set of
					users. But before this there are certain events that are
					also needed to track the user behavior. Basically creating
					events helps us understand what does user actually do when
					they perform any action?
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section5_10.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Even before creating the events we have shared the idea of
					the experiment with the developers, so that they could also
					have context and could prepare for the sprint, finally we
					<strong>handover the experiment to the dev team</strong>.
					Based upon the technicalities and suggestions we made a few
					changes and finally launched it with the 14% of new user
					base.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="result" class="section6 outside-margin">
				<h2>Results & further iteration</h2>
				<p>
					This experiment works very well and we got some good
					numbers, there’s almost <strong>12% increase</strong> as
					compared to the past numbers. Our 10+ Task creation rate
					almost becomes 12 times, but the task log % is not that high
					but still better than the past one’s.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section6_1.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					We have also checked the <strong>retention data</strong> of
					that cohort and that’s also positive and had increased as
					compared to the platform wise, but again number is not that
					high. So, we go through the
					<strong>user recordings</strong> and did a lot of
					<strong>user calls</strong> to understand user behaviours
					and their expectations from the templates. Upon completely
					analysing things, these are the
					<strong>major insights</strong> that come out -
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Users are not clicking on
						<strong>Suggestion Icon card</strong>, which is
						cluttering the space right now.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Unidentified Value of templates</strong> -
						Currently users think that Adding all tasks is
						mandatory, and are unable to find the value of
						templates.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Multiple nudges</strong> - Currently users are
						adding tasks and get nudges by other features and leave
						the application. Certain things that distracts the user
						- Update task, Invite site team, Get demo.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					To solve all these challenges, we tried to modify a few
					things and test it again with the users, here are the
					changes -
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 100%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section6_2.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Now, in the first design we’re trying to tell the value of
					templates and how it could help them, in the 2nd screen as
					soon as user adds a task we’re nudging user with the “Update
					task” coach mark, this would help the user to remain in a
					natural flow and helps us to increase the task logs as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					For the 1st problem of suggestion card, we had given
					elevation to the card + make the icon bigger, so that user
					could differentiate between the task lists and the
					suggestion card.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 70%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section6_3.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					After this we tried few more versions as well, to test
					multiple things, and finally we did our last experiment i.e.
					V6, in this we have
					<strong>categorized tasks structurally</strong> and give
					proper categories to the tasks, and we believe this would

					When we saw the results after 1 week, we saw our quality
					metric is down as compared to the “Control” version. Also,
					the base metric i.e. 10+ Task creations is also low as
					compared to past experiments, but better than the control.
					So, we did a RCA to understand why this is happening, two
					major reasons come into the notice -
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Important/Most Created tasks are far below in the
						suggestions list, previously we have put the most
						created tasks on top but in this experiment we didn’t or
						say forgot to do that (Everyone do mistakes :p). So, now
						we think because of this user is unable to find the
						required task and found templates unhelpful.
					</li>
					<li>
						Second reason is, from Mixpanel we identified the major
						project category that
						<strong>users are choosing is “Others”</strong> and in
						that category the tasks that are shown are fundamentally
						wrong, as for each task, backend team created a new
						category that leads to a lot of horizontal scrolling.
						This happens due to some miscommunication, later we
						corrected it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 70%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section6_5.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					After improving the 2nd critical issue, we saw our base &
					quality metric comes to normal, but still the retention data
					looks low as comapred with the Control.
				</p>
				<div class="img-container" style="flex-grow: 1">
					<img
						style="width: 70%"
						src="./images/powerplay/section6_6.png"
						alt=""
					/>
				</div>
				<p>
					Overall our numbers look good, so we decided to launch this
					<strong>experiment to 100% of the users</strong>, but before
					that we need to check with all other PODs/team members to
					identify how launching might affect their numbers, upon
					collaborating with all team members, we got to know
					Activation POD launches an experiment as well that collides
					with our user journey, so to resolve the same, we did
					<strong>A/B testing</strong> where we want to indentify
					which user flow helps us build the best for our users. This
					in itself is another great story, in which there are
					multiple blockers and learnings but ending this case study
					here for now :)

				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						Always listen to users, but don’t do what your users
						tell you to do.
					</li>
					<li>
						Think smart, be curious no matter what’s the occasion,
						always ask questions (a lot & no question is a bad
						question).
					</li>
					<li>
						There will be a time when you had a lot of problems to
						solve, always priortize (You see even I priortize the
						learnings 😛).
					</li>
					<li>
						Communicate things with your team, every member of your
						team must be on a same page as you are.
					</li>
					<li>
						Value data more than your assumptions. Leave your gut at
						home, it doesn’t work always in Product Development :)
					</li>
